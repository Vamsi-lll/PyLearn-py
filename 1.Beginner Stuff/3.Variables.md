Introduction to Variables in Python

Now we are going to learn about variables in Python.
Variables are very important because without variables, programming makes no sense 

What is a Variable?

A variable is a name given to a storage container that is used to store data in memory.

The variable holds the data while the program is running

Once the program stops running, the variable is destroyed

Variables help us reuse and manage data easily

Simple definition 

A variable is a name that points to a value stored in memory.

Example
name = "pylearn"
version = 1


Here:

name and version are variables

"pylearn" and 1 are values

 Important Concept

The left-hand side of the = operator is called the variable

The right-hand side is the value

The value is always assigned from right to left

👉 First the value is created,
👉 then it is stored inside the variable.

Rules for Declaring Variables in Python

When creating variable names, follow these rules 

1️⃣ A variable should not start with a number
❌ 1name
✅ name1

2️⃣ A variable should not start with a special character,
except the underscore _
❌ @name
✅ _name

3️⃣ A variable should not contain spaces
❌ user name
✅ user_name

😄 Don’t Stress!

You don’t need to memorize everything right now.
With practice, these rules will become natural.
