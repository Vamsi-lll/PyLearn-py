Understanding Data Types in Python (Concepts Only)

Before we start writing Python programs, let’s slow down and understand the concepts first.
Trust me — once the concepts are clear, coding will feel easy and fun

What is Data?

In a general sense, data is a collection of information.

Data can exist in many forms, such as:

📝 Text

🔊 Audio

🎥 Video

📊 Tables

📁 Files, and more

Now the big question is:

How does Python understand and handle this data?

That’s where Data Types come in.

## What are Data Types in Python?

Data Types tell Python:

What kind of data we are storing

How much memory it needs

What operations can be performed on it

Python classifies data into the following main categories 

Python Data Types – Flow Chart

    A[Python Data Types]

    A --> B[Value Type]
    A --> C[Collection Type]
    A --> D[Binary Type]

    B --> B1[Number Type]
    B --> B2[Non-Number Type]

    B1 --> I[int]
    B1 --> F[float]
    B1 --> CP[complex]

    B2 --> BO[bool]
    B2 --> N[None]

    C --> S[str]
    C --> L[list]
    C --> T[tuple]
    C --> SE[set]
    C --> DI[dictionary]

    D --> BY[bytes]
    D --> BA[bytearray]

🔹 1. Value Types

These data types store single values.

🔸 Number Types

Used to store numeric values:

int → whole numbers

float → decimal numbers

complex → complex numbers

🔸 Non-Number Types

Used to represent logical or empty values:

bool → True or False

None → represents “nothing” or “no value”

🔹 2. Collection Types

These data types are used to store multiple values together:

str → text data

list → ordered and changeable collection

tuple → ordered but unchangeable collection

set → unordered collection with unique values

dictionary → data stored as key–value pairs

Don’t worry if this feels like a lot —
we’ll explore each one slowly, with examples 

🔹 3. Binary Types

These are mainly used for binary data:

bytes

bytearray

You’ll usually see these when working with:

Files

Images

Network data

Don’t Panic!

Yes… there are many data types 
But here’s the good news:

- You don’t need to remember everything now
- We will learn each data type one by one
- With real examples and actual code

For now, just understand the big picture
