#     BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS vs USER-DEFINED FUNCTIONS
#====================================================

# In Python, functions are broadly classified into two types:
# 1. Built-in functions
# 2. User-defined functions


#====================================================
#               BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS
#====================================================

# Built-in functions are functions that are already provided by Python.
# We can use them directly without writing their definition.

# Python gives these functions to:
# - make development faster
# - reduce repetitive work
# - avoid writing common logic again and again
# - make code reliable and optimized

# Some commonly used built-in functions:

print("Hello Python")      # prints output
input("Enter name: ")      # takes input from user
type(10)                   # checks data type
len("Python")              # returns length
int("10")                  # type casting
float("10.5")
str(100)
bool(1)
range(5)


#====================================================
#            WHY BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS EXIST
#====================================================

# Imagine writing logic for printing, input handling,
# type checking, or conversions every time.
# That would be slow and error-prone.

# Built-in functions:
# - save time
# - improve consistency
# - are tested and optimized
# - allow developers to focus on problem-solving


#====================================================
#            USER-DEFINED FUNCTIONS
#====================================================

# User-defined functions are functions created by the programmer
# to perform specific tasks based on application requirements.

# These functions are created using the 'def' keyword.

# Example:

def greet(name):
    print("Hello", name)

greet("Vamsi")
greet("Python Learner")


#====================================================
#        WHY USER-DEFINED FUNCTIONS ARE NEEDED
#====================================================

# Built-in functions solve general problems.
# But every application has unique requirements.

# User-defined functions help to:
# - write custom logic
# - reduce code repetition
# - organize large programs
# - improve readability and maintainability


#====================================================
#        BUILT-IN vs USER-DEFINED (SUMMARY)
#====================================================

# Built-in functions:
# - Provided by Python
# - Ready to use
# - General-purpose

# User-defined functions:
# - Created by programmer
# - Customized logic
# - Application-specific
